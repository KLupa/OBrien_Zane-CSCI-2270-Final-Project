# OBrien_Zane-Final-Project
CSCI 2270

Project	Summary 

  My project builds off of Assignment 9 which only allowed the user to insert, delete, find, and display movies that were entered in by the user. My Final project will allow the user to have many more options like selling movies, sorting the movies by year, sorting alphabetically (A-Z) and (Z-A), how much money you have made from selling movies, and displaying movies from a certain time period. Each movie struct will now include a price.
